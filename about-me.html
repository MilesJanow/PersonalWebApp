                <p>I have lived in Ohio my entire life, and I like it here. I
                    like to explore other areas too, but the there's
                    something about the seasonal Midwest atmosphere
                    that keeps me close to home. I just can't stay out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shire" target="_blank">The Shire</a> for too
                    long.

                    I have always been interested in technology; it's
                    why I started my academic career in engineering.
                    Using technology can be frustrating and unintuitive
                    at times, but I think technology can be harnessed in
                    ways that improve the human experience and make
                    our lives better. I think it's important that
                    technology is used and created ethically as well, and
                    I have dedicated some of my time to discussing
                    ethical questions relating to technology in the
                    Applied Ethics and Technology club at Ohio State.

                    I also love space. I think the future of humanity
                    depends on our ability to venture out into the stars,
                    and it's a very exciting time in the aerospace
                    industry right now. This passion for space
                    exploration is why I chose to study aerospace
                    engineering early on in college. I actually switched
                    from mechanical engineering, which upon reflection
                    probably would have been a better choice. I don't
                    mind though. I think following your heart can take
                    you to a good place in the end.

                    I have a strong passion for the arts. I did choir and
                    was part of an acapella group in high school. I even
                    did show choir one year, but I'm definitely not a
                    dancer. I have always been shy, but there's
                    something about performing music that brings me
                    out of my shell. I also like to compose music as a
                    hobby. I'm not great at it, but you can check out
                    some samples of my work in the <a href="music.html">music page</a>. I also
                    view video games as the ultimate artistic medium.
                    There's no other type of art that can immerse you
                    in another world as much as a video game, and as
                    virtual reality becomes more immersive the line
                    between reality and the virtual world will continue
                    to blur. Some of my all-time favorite games are
                    Final Fantasy 7, Super Mario Galaxy, and Everhood.
                    I also really like movies, and I used to be really into
                    special effects, which is how I got into video editing.
                    I also made some props as a child, and I've attached
                    a picture of a lightsaber that I built when I was
                    younger. My favorite movie is The Matrix.
                    <br><br>
                    I like helping people and playing support. When I
                    was involved in Sigma Gamma Tau during my time
                    as an aerospace engineering major, I got the
                    opportunity to help with some of the review
                    sessions. These sessions were created so that more
                    experienced students could help students in lower-level
                    aerospace classes do better. It was also an
                    opportunity to reflect on material learned earlier
                    and to improve my own knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm currently on a break from school, but when I
                    return, I would like to do some courses in
                    philosophy and architecture. I'm naturally curious
                    about a lot of things, and I think it's good to take
                    some time to explore different ideas and broaden
                    my skillset.
