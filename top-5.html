                <h2>Number 5:</h2>
                <h3>Lego Ferrari F8 Tributo</h3>
                <p>I recently started collecting the 8 stud Speed Champions line sports cars, and this is one of the first ones made. The sleek design and color really makes it stand out from the others.</p>

                <h2>Number 4:</h2>
                <h3>Deep Sea Striker</h3>
                <p>I have a weird liking for giant animals made deadly, and this set is just perfect when it comes to that liking. I was honestly considering putting it higher on the list,
                    but a scorpion placing in first would be kind of weird. The color scheme looks amazing too!</p>

                <h2>Number 3:</h2>
                <h3>Medieval Blacksmith</h3>
                <p>This set is pretty good, was a good value before lego increased the price, and the black falcons starred here are awesome because that is my favorite LEGO medieval faction.</p>

                <h2>Number 2:</h2>
                <h3>Witch Doctor</h3>
                <p>Giant Hero Factory villain, is poseable, and looks super cool. I got this from a trade this with my brother for some DS games a while back. I don't regret it.</p>

                <h2>Honorable Mention:</h2>
                <h3>Stingray Stormer</h3>
                <p>I got this from a vintage toy shop in Sandusky for a really good price. it is from 1998, and while I no longer own the set, it still holds place in my memory as a relic in LEGO's history.</p>

                <h2>Number 1:</h2>
                <h3>Vladek's Dark Fortress</h3>
                <p>My friend recently sold me this one, and it was not only a great build, but it looks amazing to display. The old castle sets from the 2000s have a special charm that the new ones just can't match.</p>
